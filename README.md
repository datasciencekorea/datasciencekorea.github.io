## ABOUT

A knowledge graph is large networks of entities, their semantic types, properties, and relationships between entities. It ultimately facilitates the creation of information necessary for machines to understand the world in the manner that humans do. Companies that aim to serve intelligent services such as Google, Microsoft, or IBM are applying the knowledge graph widely to its real-world services. 

Obtaining a primary data source is critical to construct a knowledge graph, since building a new knowledge from scratch is not trivial. As we have already experienced, Wikipedia as open data has been widely used for constructing new knowledge across a variety of domains. Recently, significant amounts of data are published as open data in research, commercial and governments. These data can be a starting point for constructing a domain-specific knowledge graph through the interlinking of heterogeneous data.
