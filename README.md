## ABOUT

A knowledge graph is large networks of entities, their semantic types, properties, and relationships between entities. It ultimately facilitates the creation of information necessary for machines to understand the world in the manner that humans do. Companies that aim to serve intelligent services such as Google, Microsoft, or IBM are applying the knowledge graph widely to its real-world services. 

Obtaining a primary data source is critical to construct a knowledge graph, since building a new knowledge from scratch is not trivial. As we have already experienced, Wikipedia as open data has been widely used for constructing new knowledge across a variety of domains. Recently, significant amounts of data are published as open data in research, commercial and governments. These data can be a starting point for constructing a domain-specific knowledge graph through the interlinking of heterogeneous data. 

This workshop aims to share and discuss about knowledge graph techniques based on open data both academia and industries. In particular, this workshop focuses on various use cases including data wrangling, data analysis, data visualization in the prospect of Data Science, and technical challenges to construct structured knowledge from large-scale raw data (focused on open data).

### SUBMISSIONS OPTIONS

Because we are looking to promote discussion about an emerging area, we encourage authors to submit various types:

* Works-In-Progress: To facilitate sharing of thought-provoking ideas and high-potential though preliminary research, authors are welcome to make submissions describing early-stage, in-progress, and/or exploratory work.
* Demonstrations: Demos should be submitted as video (e.g. MP4). Demos should be submitted with an abstract or short paper. Submitted demo videos should be no longer than 5 minutes.
* Traditional Papers: short paper (2 pages) or long paper (5 to 10 pages)
* Posters

### SUBMISSIONS SITE


Submissions should be made to DSKG2019 on EasyChair submission page. 

Submitted papers should conform to the Springer LNCS style and should describe, in English, original work that has not been published or submitted for publication elsewhere. 

Selected papers will be invited to submit an extended full paper for peer-reviewed publication in special issues.
