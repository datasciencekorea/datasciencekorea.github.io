## ABOUT

A knowledge graph is large networks of entities, their semantic types, properties, and relationships between entities. It ultimately facilitates the creation of information necessary for machines to understand the world in the manner that humans do. Companies that aim to serve intelligent services such as Google, Microsoft, or IBM are applying the knowledge graph widely to its real-world services. 

Obtaining a primary data source is critical to construct a knowledge graph, since building a new knowledge from scratch is not trivial. As we have already experienced, Wikipedia as open data has been widely used for constructing new knowledge across a variety of domains. Recently, significant amounts of data are published as open data in research, commercial and governments. These data can be a starting point for constructing a domain-specific knowledge graph through the interlinking of heterogeneous data. 

This workshop aims to share and discuss about knowledge graph techniques based on open data both academia and industries. In particular, this workshop focuses on various use cases including data wrangling, data analysis, data visualization in the prospect of Data Science, and technical challenges to construct structured knowledge from large-scale raw data (focused on open data).

* Su-Seong Chai, Dongjun Suh, A Design of Building Inventory for Risk Analysis using Open Data 

> This study introduces a design of building inventory for risk analysis using open data in Korea. Recently, disasters of various sizes and types are occur-ring globally. Risk analysis tools are used to estimate the losses due to dis-asters. However, there is a limitation in the application of disaster statisti-cal data in Korea because these data are based on the country where the tool is produced. To improve the accuracy of loss assessment, it is necessary to utilize data in consideration of each country's environment. However, the data opened at the national level are distributed among various organiza-tions. Thus, considerable time is required to build infrastructure. Therefore, we collect the open data distributed among various institutions and ensure data compatibility and interoperability through the standardization of the data in various formats. In addition to a disaster analysis system, a design method for a database system that can support various analysis systems through the data is proposed considering scalability.

* Yeonsoo Lim, Daehyeon Bong, and Yuchul Jung, An Automatic Keyprhase Extraction and Refinement for Scientific Articles

> Keyphrase extraction is a fundamental, but very important task in NLP that map documents to a set of representative words/phrases. However, state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets are still immature stage. As an effort to alleviate the gaps between human annotated keyphrases and automatically extracted ones, in this paper, we perform an in-depth study on how to extract meaningful keyphrases of scientific research articles in a supervised way. Moreover, we investigate several avenues of refining and re-ranking the extracted ones using pre-trained word embeddings and summarization techniques. Evaluation are performed on two different datasets (WWW and KDD) in computer science domain.

* Min Jung Lee, Jiyoung Woo, A Study on the characteristics of the Long-term Web Forum Users using Social Network Analysis

> A web forum is an online place where people who are interested in a specific topic talk with each other. Web forums are used by short-term users as well as long-term users. This paper proposes the methodology of the time series social network analysis to identify the role of long-term users in the web forum. In particular, this study analyzes the influences of the social network of the Alzheimer's medical web forum and suggests strategies to help patients, their family and medical officials suffering from Alzheimer.


* Jiseong Son, Quality Assessment of Public Data: Focusing on Open Standard Data

> Public data refer to all materials and data produced by public organizations, or public information that results in the communication and cooperation of peo-ple. Public data are perceived as an important medium that drives the next generation of new industries such as artificial intelligence and smart city. In this perspective, the government continues to open public data. In interna-tional assessments related to the openness of public data, South Korea has been ranked high continuously. However, despite the continuous opening of public data, the use of public data or the industrial effect is at a low level. Par-tial data are opened from source systems possessed by public organizations as public data; in this process, the semantics of the data may be lost. Further-more, because there is a lack of consistency in the data contents and expres-sion formats of open public data, data quality has always been a concern. In this study, a comparative analysis of public data quality is performed and methods are proposed to improve the data quality based on institutional and technical perspectives. In particular, for quality assessment, the analysis is conducted based on completeness and accuracy by targeting the open stand-ard data of public data portals.

* Jiyee Jeon, Soohyeon Chae, and Jangwon Gim, Technical invention trend analysis of applicantsbased on CPC classification

> Recently, with the rapid development of science and technology, new technologies are rapidly emerging, and applicants are making efforts to acquire intellectual property rights to prevail the competitive advantage of technology and enhance technological competitiveness. As a result, the number of patents invented increases rapidly every year, and the ripple effects of the developed technologies are also increasing in terms of social and economic aspects. Therefore, applicants are focusing on evaluating the value of existing invented technologies to invent more valuable technologies. Although existing patent analysis studies mainly focus on discovering core technologies among the technologies derived from patents or analyzing trend changes for specific techniques. Therefore, the analysis of applicants who develop such core technologies is insufficient. In this paper, we propose a model for analyzing the technical inventions of applicants based on CPC classification codes. Through the proposed model, the common invention patterns of applicants are extracted, and the technical inventions of applicants are analyzed using the patterns. We prove that applicants have different invention patterns and trends in inventing technologies.

* Haklae Kim, Knowledge Exploration from Tables on the Web
> The importance of a knowledge base is emphasised with explosive growth of artificial intelligence services. Building a knowledge base is not an easy task and requires a variety of techniques to extract and construct knowledge from large data sources. This paper focuses on extracting knowledge from a web table of a web document. In particular, it proposes a method to determine a set of candidates to be extracted by evaluating the quality of a table before extracting the knowledge directly from the collected tables. The information contained in the table is evaluated in terms of completeness and accuracy of the data. This approach can reduce the time required to extract knowledge and improve the accuracy of knowledge transformation.
